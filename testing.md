There are two basic parts in react testing

## 1/Functional 
## 2/Non function

For Functional we will use 4 phase of testing
# 1/Unit testing 
# 2/ Integration testing
# 3/ E2E testing
# 4/ Sanity testing

For automation test primary plan to use 
    mocha -> Unit testing & integration of rest api
    supertest -> As rest api testing framework
    mocha--coverage(istanbul)-> For see testing coverage
    postman -> For sanity testing
    chai -> For assertion framework
    
The big challenger here is that doing test of async function
CI CD will also be available with azure

We will try to follow tdd( test driven development)
