There are two basic parts in react testing

## 1/Functional 
## 2/Non function

For Functional we will use 4 phase of testing
# 1/Unit testing 
# 2/ Integration testing
# 3/ E2E testing
# 4/ Sanity testing

For automation test primary plan to use 
    jest -> Unit testing & integration of rest api
    supertest -> As rest api testing framework
    jest--coverage(lcov)-> For see testing civerage
    postman -> For sanity testing

CI CD will also be available with azure

We will try to follow tdd( test driven development)
